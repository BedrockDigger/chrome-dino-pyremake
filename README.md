### Intro
This is my small attempt of reverse-engineering the [chrome://dino](chrome://dino "Click on this only if you're on a chromium-based browser XD") game in Python by using the Pygame module. The original game is only an inspiration, so the rules might be completely different.
Anyway, thanks a lot if you'd like to try it! ðŸ˜Š
Issues are always open for new ideas and good suggestions.

### How to play
**1** Since the game depends on Pygame, you surely have to install it first with `pip`.
###### Linux / Mac OS X
```shell
pip install pygame
```
###### Windows
```shell
py -m pip install -U pygame
```
**2** Clone this repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/BedrockDigger/chrome-dino-pyremake
```
3 Now simply launch main.py and have fun!
###### Linux / Mac OS X
```shell
cd ./chrome-dino-pyremake
python ./main.py
```
###### Windows
```shell
cd .\chrome-dino-pyremake
py .\main.py
```
